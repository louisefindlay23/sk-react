## The Sock Kingdom - A React Prismic Site

### Purpose

Develop a basic website using Prismic and React that uses React Router and Route Resolver to create a dynamic Navigation menu.

### About the website

The Sock Kingdom website contains three blog posts about buying socks which are displayed on the homepage. The HTML serializer was used to render `h2` elements as Pig Latin via the [`piglatin`](https://github.com/montanaflynn/piglatin) module and code snippet field as a `code` element via the codespan custom label. A React component was used to store part of the HTML Serializer.

The blog post content was generated via [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) and author profiles using [AI Writer](https://tools.picsart.com/text/ai-writer). All blog post images were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).
